# React + Vite +tailwindcss

# create this project for practice ,steping towards best portfolio site for me .

# it has Darkmode and Lightmode with toggle button .

# To manage the 'themeMode' state , I use contextApi which is simply best for simple projects. although i test with it with redux toolkit too :D
